```{r setupdb, include=FALSE}
# path to sqlite path here
db <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "/Users/nishant/Desktop/data_science/hw2/lahman2016.sqlite")
```


1) How many franchises are listed in the database (see [`count`](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#count))?

```{sql q1, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
select count(*) from TeamsFranchises;
```

2) How many franchises are currently active?

```{sql q2, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
select count(*) from TeamsFranchises 
where active = "Y";
```

3) Which teams won more than 100 games in one season between 2000 and 2015? Order result by descending number of wins. (attribute `W` of the Teams table contains the number of wins)

```{sql q3, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
select teamID, yearID, W from Teams 
where W > 100 
and yearID between 2000 and 2015
order by W desc;
```


4) What is the franchise name of the team with the most total wins in the database?

```{sql q4, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
select franchName, teamID, max(s) from 
(select franchName, teamID, sum(W) as s from
Teams join TeamsFranchises on Teams.franchID = TeamsFranchises.franchID
group by teamID) 
```

5) What is the franchise name of the team with the highest winning percentage in a season in the database? (Win percentage is `W/G`)

```{sql q5, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
select franchName, yearID, teamID, max(p) from

(select franchName, yearID, teamID, 1.0 * W / G as p from
Teams join TeamsFranchises on Teams.franchID = TeamsFranchises.franchID
group by teamID, yearID);
```

6) What is the franchise name of the team with the highest single-year payroll between 2000 and 2015?

```{sql q6, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
select yearID, teamID, franchName, max(s) from
(select Teams.franchID, franchName, Teams.yearID, Teams.teamID, sum(salary) as s from Teams join Salaries on Teams.yearID = Salaries.yearID join TeamsFranchises on Teams.franchID = TeamsFranchises.franchID
where Salaries.yearID between 2000 and 2015
group by Salaries.teamID, Salaries.yearID)
```
